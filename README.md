# Rasayana_io
Rasayana (alchemy/path of essence) is an NFT-based computer card game who's arena mode is roughly modelled after Magic The Gathering: Arena.

Target level of art and mechanics complexity is aimed for somewhere between MGT:A and Hearthstone.

Further functionality includes tradable NFTs that can be minted, forged to higher rarity level, and traded on a robust marketplace and gallery application.

Game mode components will include a hexagonal grid territory control mechanic whereby land tiles can be won, lost, and controlled within the Rasayana metaverse.
Rasayana metaverse is targetted to integrate within the Cornucopias island world and interface with PlayerMint marketplace in the sense of cross chain compatibility and functionality with the PMX tokenomics.

Many components of the functionality are still in development with other projects, but will be integrated and iterated and shared with the community over time.

This is an open source project operated under MIT license guidelines.
