# Rasayana (Sanskrit for alchemy or path of essence)
Rasayana (alchemy) is an NFT-based trading card game roughly modelled after Magic The Gathering: Arena.

The purpose of this document is to compile ideas for a Crypto Heroes NFT. The idea is to foster greater cross-pollination between the Cardano Community and the PIVX Community. It should also be used to help fund the PIVX Foundation and the work that they are doing. (UPDATE: first do core cryptocurrency space lore and story, then do Cardano heroes packs, then PIVX heroes packs).

Thus far I have contacted Marco Guerrero (Marco the Black) from the NFT Update community and Bryan Doreian (SnappySnap) from the PIVX community and have buy-in from both.

Next, we need to work out some details about how it will run so that we can present it to the Cardano community and get buy-in from there. Helping to fund the project with a governance proposal should also help with bringing more of the community into the fold. We'll also need to get buy-in from the Cardano community and probably the best tool for that would be a proposal there as well once there is enough material to show proof of concept.

Now, one issue might be that the limited size and participation of the community might also limit the participation and cause it to die out after the initial excitement. I see this happening with many of the NFTs that are being issued now. I expect the majority of them to die out. 80/20. 20% of the projects will suck up 80% of the market. How to be in that 20%?

One way is to construct the deck in such a way as to make the barrier to entry very low. Let us say 8 ADA for each card, and all cards are basic level with hidden seeds of higher potential.

We want to be able to build the deck over time and upgrade cards by combining them. The elements that would go into it would be items that attach to each of the heroes. Such as different pedestals, right hand, left hand, clothing (tunic, robe, etc), cape, pet, amulet, halo (energy symbol above the head), and background.

The deck should have its own compelling reason to collect even if you’ve never heard of the project before. Also, there should be lore unlocked with more and more cards.

There should also be a primary color theme red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. Combining primary-colored cards should create more interesting patterns and backgrounds based on the algorithmic fusion of each seed from each card.

There would also be cards related to notable events such as the funding of various sports teams, athletes,  and the robotics club. Included in this would be events related to major upgrades of the wallet and protocol. In all, people that know nothing of the project can learn in bite-sized pieces as they collect the deck.

There would be no limit to the total number of cards (i.e. no total issue size). Instead, you create rarity and value by purchasing the base cards with hidden attributes and combine them to power up.

This would ideally lead to a continuous supply of initial funding to the Cardano Foundation, Catalyst, (and Iterative Alchemy Cardano Stake Pool) as people continue to buy more cards. Once they make the initial purchase all profits from trading in the market would be theirs.

In keeping with the user choices in creating the deck they want, the objects would be tiered and this would allow for higher tier objects to override the lesser. The collector would be able to combine either two or three cards to give additional choices about the result he’s looking for.

As for rarity in the initial draw, there would be a slim chance of rolling an animation card, and an almost impossibly small chance of rolling a golden animation card. Perhaps the probability would increase with higher tier cards, but the desire is to encourage continued trading and combining until you get just what you want, and then you ‘lock it in’ thus creating a unique card that can never be created again.

In this way, if a player happened to get an animated or gold animated card, they can still combine it with other cards to tweak it just the way they want it before locking it in and creating this unique one-of-a-kind card that can never be created again.

The deck would be open to additions so that new events and new heroes can be added over time. This is crucial to the ongoing health of the project as it provides continuing income streams to fund further development.

Future goals include fostering strong collaboration between the Cardano project and the PIVX project such that they multiply against each other and enrich the combined community at large.

The cards should consist of base cards for the heroes and mod cards for upgrading the hero cards. The mod cards would be the tools, weapons, clothing items, poses, colors, backgrounds, etc that custom modify the base hero card. Prismatic (RARE) would be created by the user by combining certain cards (say one of the same hero in each color). In this instance you would combine one of each color plus a prismatic 'level up' card to make a permanent unalterable Rare. If you don't use the Prismatic level up, you could trade it at a premium. Then, there will be maybe  dozen unique (gold) power ups. They would be used in a similar fashion to prismatic power ups with the same restriction that once you use them they can never be altered and can never be copied. There will always only be one unique of whatever attributes that base card held. 

As for pets, it’s possible that a PIVX Pals deck could also be created that uses the same engine and technology but focuses on the pets, their toys, collars, accessories, and the like. I feel having cute little pets with an array of accessories would appeal to a certain target audience, but that the PIVX (Crypto) Heroes set should probably go out first to drive initial interest and prototype the technology.
